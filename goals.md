# Introduction

**The mission of the Layers Project is to redistribute decision-making power over the natural and built environment by making information about the material and energetic basis of human life accessible to all.**

To accomplish this mission, the Layers Project will observe -- and continuously re-observe -- every consequential act of extraction, transformation, refinement, transportation, distribution, and disposal of material and energy resources on the planet. The Project will make all of this data accessible to anyone, for any purpose, with exceptions only for uses that directly support violence or physical harm. Profit-seeking use of the data is allowed, and even encouraged, under commercial terms.

Because the data collected by the Layers Project is available to all, it will be accessible to -- and accessed by -- governments and private entities. A core principle of the Project is that its existence must not increase the coercive control of existing power centers over individuals and societies.

The Layers Project does not pierce the household veil. It does not collect data about individuals, their behaviors -- whether as individuals, consumers, or employees. It does not track the movements of privately-owned vehicles, the shipments or packages that arrive at homes, or gatherings or activities that occur in public or private spaces. Where such information is inadvertently collected, robust processes will be created and maintained to remove it from the system at the earliest possible point. 

The Project will be a collective effort of many people, diverse in skillset, ability, location, age, and culture. The means of its production -- observation, checking, data distribution, governance, and so on -- are designed to foster sustainability, equitability, and collective reward. Many people will have to devote substantial time and effort to the endeavor over decades, and the Project is designed to reward all participants commensurate with their contributions.

# Goals

> Move from a mindset of material abundance and energy scarcity to the opposite -- material scarcity and energy abundance.


# Political Stances

The Layers Project uses social and technological means to achieve societal, political, and ecosystem goals.

## Surveillance to sousveillance
Governments and corporations can observe individuals and communities much more effectively than the reverse. To a large extent, their advantage lies in the centralization of capital and control. By making judicious use of technology, the Project will harness the actions of many individuals into a unified resource that, in aggregate, observes the behavior of powerful societal actors that have until now operated in the expectation that their actions -- even when undertaken in plain sight -- will not be observed.

## Effective collective action on the climate crisis
The climate crisis – not just climate *change*, but the stubborn persistence of the modes of production in the face of our clear scientific understanding of the situation we face, and at odds with the interests of the vast majority of people on earth – is a product of the cultural, economic, corporate, and political power structures that reside in our current era.

There are several approaches to subverting and remaking these power structures: traditional movement building, social organization, and protest that undermine social license; new modes of political organization and coordination, especially those enabled by networked technology; and direct action, including property destruction and other forms of sabotage, both to draw attention to the excesses and hypocrisies of the incumbents and to simply smash the infrastructural chokepoints of the carbon cartels.

This toolkit is incomplete, though, because it neglects what we'll call the **societal noosphere** – the web of knowledge and thought we collectively inhabit – and, crucially, the norms and behaviors that we subsequently adopt to relate with one another and thrive within it. The last two decades provide many examples of sociotechnical systems that have, in a few years each and with demonstrably plausible resources, changed many elemental aspects of lived human experience. The difference is the intention behind, and consequently the design and governance of, these efforts – liberatory rather than oppressive, distributive rather than accumulative, humane rather than callously utilitarian.

## Fuck the techbrocracy
