# Principles

1. **Stop at the front door.**

   The Layers Project is expansive in its scope, but it adheres rigidly to one major constraint: the project does not collect data about individuals, households, or private lives.

2. **Ground truth over corporate truth.**
   
   Partly due to the financialization of the global economy, assets are constantly shifting ownership. While corporate control and ownership can be helpful, and is sometimes relevant to the Project's activities, observations are centered on real-world activities.

3. **Choose the access-maximizing path.**

   The Project allows for commercial uses of its observations and derivative products, but many such uses depend on the exclusivity of the data.
