# Overview

The Layers Project is a massively distributed effort to *observe* and *make accessible* all of the material and energetic activites relevant to human life on Earth. For an undertaking of this scale to be tractable and sustainable, it must rest on a foundation of simple concepts that balance specificity and flexibility.

# The Societal Umwelt

What would it mean for a global society to be aware of its surroundings, to reach and maintain situational awareness, such that it could act and react on appropriate time scales and in its own interest? What would it need to sense? What would its sensory organs need to take in, and how would they need to function? It is the answer to these questions, if we can indeed answer them, that constitute the scope of the Layers Project.

What is within this scope in positive terms? Above we have referred, very broadly, to "the material and energetic activities relevant to human life on Earth." But this is ungainly. Is there a term, preferably pre-existing, that encompasses this idea more succinctly? At risk of immediately descending into jargon, we call up on the concept of the **umwelt**. This is a term, obscure in regular discourse but familiar in biology and ethology, that describes the subjective world that an organism perceives -- and that the organism is capable of apprehending given its sensory apparatus, its bodily configuration, and other basic facts of its lived existence.

The philosopher and semiotician John Deely explained the relation between the organism and its sensed environment this way:

> The physical environment...is not the world in which any given species as such actually lives out its life. No. Each biological life-form, by reason of its distinctive bodily constitution (its ‘biological heritage’, as we may say), is suited only to certain parts and aspects of the vast physical universe. And when this ‘suitedness to’ takes the bodily form of cognitive organs, such as our own senses, or the often quite different sensory modalities discovered in other lifeforms, then those aspects and only those aspects of the physical environment which are proportioned to those modalities become ‘objectified’, that is to say, made present not merely physically but cognitively as well.

-- [John Deely](https://web.archive.org/web/20060221134707/http://www.ut.ee/SOSE/deely.htm)

In other words, every organism -- and, we wil say, every complex system that senses and acts in its environment -- takes in information from its surroundings and constructs an internal representation that 1) corresponds to its sensory apparatus, and 2) matches its needs to act and survive in that environment.

What the Layers Project is after, therefore, is the creation of a "societal umwelt". Going back to Deely, we need only very lightly adapt some of his text to see how well the concept fits the higher-order organism of society:

> The relations (that obtain between whatever may be ‘in fact’ present physically in the surroundings and the cognitive constitution of the [societal] organism interacting with those surroundings) are not mainly between the society and what is sensed. No. The relations in question concern above all how the limited and partial sensory aspects of the physical environment are connected among themselves so as to constitute objects of experience, and this constitution depends above all on the constitution of the society doing the sensing. For it is the interests of that society, not the ‘independent’ nature of the source of the sensory stimuli, that is at issue in the perception as such that the society finally acts upon and uses to orientate itself within the environment for the purposes of its life and well-being.

-- Adapted from Deely, [ibid.](https://web.archive.org/web/20060221134707/http://www.ut.ee/SOSE/deely.htm)

# Material and Energy

But what is the environment which our global society inhabits and from which its umwelt is drawn? Now we return to our formulation of the "material and energetic activites relevant to human life on Earth," and we ask what this comprises.

The Layers Project is concerned with both matter -- which we will more often refer to as material -- and energy. A full observation of human life, in both the built and natural environments, must include both in its field of view.

## Material

The materials that are relevant to human life are so varied as to seem overwhelming, covering everything from raw mining outputs to intermediate products to finished goods. Because these materials are all traded internationally, however, great care has been taken by relevant bodies to classify every material good using systems such as the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System), administered by the [World Customs Organization](https://www.wcoomd.org/); the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC); the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC); and others.

## Energy

All of the energy that is put to work on the planet derives from a very few primary sources. Most is from sunlight, with relatively small amounts from the heat caused by gravitic action and the energy released from atomic fission. From these few sources, energy is stored through chemical, biological, and physical processes; changed from one form to another, including being dissipated as heat; put to work in transportation, manufacture, private life, and other uses; and transported over great distances.

### Generation

When we talk about energy "generation" -- i.e., power plants -- we mean in most cases the transformation of one form of energy that is available in the environment into electrical energy that can then be transported by power lines to other destinations for use. Solar photovoltaics transform solar irradiance into electricity via the photoelectric effect; hydropower plants transform the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water into electricity via turbines; thermal power plants transform the chemical energy in fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, or petroleum into heat, and then into electricity -- again via turbine generators.

### Transportation

### Storage


# Stocks, Flows, and Transformations

Borrowing from the theory of complex systems, we find that a few simple concepts can be used to model even the vast and diverse movements of material and energy in our world. 

## Stocks and Reservoirs

For our definition of a **Stock**, we turn to the complex systems theorist Donella Meadows:

> A stock is the foundation of any system. Stocks are the elements in the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time. A system stock is just what it sounds like: a store, a quantity, an accumulation of material or information that has built up over time. It may be the water in a bathtub, a population, the books in a bookstore, the wood in a tree, the money in the bank, your own self-confidence.

-- Donella Meadows, "Thinking in Systems"

While a stock is an actual amount of energy or material, it must exist in some appropriate container -- whether a purpose-built one, a natural or semi-natural vessel, or even just appropriately cleared earth. To reflect this, a stock is always paired with a **Reservoir**, our general term for such containers.

## Flows and Conveyances

We return to Donella Meadows to define a **Flow**:

> Flows are filling and draining, births and deaths, purchases and sales, growth and decay, deposits and withdrawals, successes and failures. A stock, then, is the present memory of the history of changing flows within a system.

-- Donella Meadows, "Thinking in Systems"

## Transformations
To these well-established, foundational concepts we add one more: the *transformation*

# Observations

The Layers Project does not capture reality, much less truth, but rather a collection of fallible observations. 

> Technology, like democracy, includes ideas and practices; it includes myths and various models of reality. And like democracy, technology changes the social and individual relationships between us. It has forced us to examine and redefine our notions of power and of accountability....Technology is not the sum of the artifacts, of the wheels and gears, of the rails and electronic transmitters. Technology is a *system*. It entails far more than its individual material components. Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset.

-- Ursula Franklin, "The Real World of Technology"

## Time, Place, Means

The observations that form the raw material of the Layers Project are situated in time and place, and they are made by particular means. For example, a shipping container can be observed with a mobile phone at a certain timestamp, and with particular latitute and longitude coordinates. Or an iron ore mine can be noted at a certain place from satellite imagery viewed in an online mapping application. Or an entire collection of dam locations might be loaded from a dataset published by a government agency.

As can be seen from these brief examples, observation methods vary widely. Some are made directly, by an individual and a mobile device *in situ*, while others are mediated by other data collection and processing efforts. These collection methods differ in their reliability, their breadth, and their ability to access various targets of observation.

## Completeness and Correctness

## Sousveillance and Power

> The web of technology can indeed be woven differently, but even to discuss such intentional change of pattern requires an examination of the features of the current patterns and an understanding of the origins and the purpose of the present designs.

-- Ursula Franklin, "The Real World of Technology" (52)

# Incentives and Sustainability

The Layers Project is not just the data that is collected, and the system that stores and disseminates that data. It is also, equally and essentially, the social and even cultural system that produces, sustains, corrects, and continuously improves those artifacts.
