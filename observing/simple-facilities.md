This document covers the observation of simple and easily-located facilities, those which can be both found and properly described from public data sources and mapping applications. These facilities might include

* Power plants
* Power substations
* Material stockpiles
* Mines (especially open pit)

1. Identify candidate(s)
   1. For example, search the web for "List of Nickel mines in Indonesia"
   2. If you find a list, perform the following steps for one entry at a time
2. Locate the facility on satellite
   1. Search using the name of the facility. You may need to use variations on the facility's name, or nearby towns. 
   2. This part can take some creativity and/or visual searching, depending on how visible the facility type is from satellite imagery. Once you understand what a facility type looks like in satellite imagery, it can be easier to find other examples of that same type.
3. Match with OSM ways/relations
   1. Whichever mapping application you use to identify the facility, locate it in OpenStreetMap and determine whether one or more OSM ways or relations correspond to it
4. Add OSM ways/relations if needed
   1. If there are no OSM features that correspond to the facility, you should consider adding 
5. Add to Anytype
6. Consider adding dedicated conveyances, if needed
